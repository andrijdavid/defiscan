# Summary


Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure. It introduces the 'Internet Bond,' a globally accessible dollar-denominated rewards instrument. Ethena's synthetic dollar, USDe, is fully backed by staked crypto assets (Etherum and Bitcoin) and its corresponding short futures positions. Ethena employs delta-hedging strategies to maintain stability and generate yields for users.
